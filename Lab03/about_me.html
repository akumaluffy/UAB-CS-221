    <h2>
        About Me
    </h2>
    <p>
        A little backstory about myself. I was a pre-med in college and have a B.S. in psychology and did clinical research for 4 years focusing on effects of childhood abuse on obesity. The Covid pandemic began during my gap year after graduating, and it was during that time I decided to drop medical school and commit myself to working in the intersection between technology and medicine. I hope to bring the use of A.I. to medicine in the future to ease the workload for healthcare workers.
