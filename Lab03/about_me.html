    <h2>
        About Me
    </h2>
    <p>
        A little backstory about myself. I was a pre-med in college and graduated with B.S. in psychology. During undergrad I also worked in clinical research for 4 years focusing on effects of childhood abuse on obesity. The Covid pandemic began during my gap year after graduating, and it was during that time I decided to drop medical school and commit myself to working within the intersection between technology and medicine. My goal is to help integrate new A.I. technologies with medicine.
